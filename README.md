## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Application structure and semantic markup
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality and interactivity
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling and responsive design framework
- **LocalStorage API**: Client-side data persistence
- **UUID Library**: Unique identifier generation for tasks

### Code Architecture

The application follows a simple MVC-like pattern:

1. **Data Model**: Tasks are stored as JSON objects with the following properties:
   - `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
   - `text`: Task description
   - `completed`: Boolean status flag
   - `createdAt`: Timestamp of creation

2. **Core Functions**:
   - `addTodo()`: Creates and adds a new task
   - `toggleTodo()`: Changes the completion status of a task
   - `deleteTodo()`: Removes a task with animation
   - `clearCompleted()`: Removes all completed tasks
   - `filterTodos()`: Changes the current view filter
   - `renderTodos()`: Updates the UI based on current data
   - `updateCounters()`: Updates task counts and UI elements
   - `saveTodos()`: Persists task data to localStorage

### Data Flow

1. User interactions trigger event listeners
2. Event handlers modify the task data
3. Data is saved to localStorage
4. UI is re-rendered to reflect changes

## User Guide

### Adding Tasks

1. Type your task in the input field at the top
2. Press Enter or click the "Add" button
3. Your new task appears at the top of the list

### Managing Tasks

- **Delete a task**: Hover over a task and click the trash icon that appears
- **Filter tasks**: Click "All", "Active", or "Completed" buttons
- **Clear completed tasks**: Click "Clear completed" at the bottom

### Data Persistence

- All changes are automatically saved to your browser's localStorage
- Tasks will remain even if you close the browser or refresh the page
- Data is stored locally on your device and not sent to any server

## Customization Possibilities

The application could be extended with:

- Dark/light theme toggle
- Task categories or tags
- Due dates and reminders
